# Welcome to Jie's Blog

## Nice to meet you, this is Jie Wang.

Student at the University of Manchester and my research interests are 3D models and medical image segmentation.  

Right now I'm working on a 3D human model project and a secret corporate project involving deep learning and medical applications.
