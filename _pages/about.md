Nice to meet you! I‚Äôm Jie Wang, currently a PhD student at the School of Computer Science, University of Nottingham. I previously graduated from the University of Manchester and Donghua University. My research interests include large multimodal models and medical imaging. I have published papers in several top-tier journals and conferences, including Nature Communications, Medical Image Analysis (MIA).

[Development of deep learning-based narrow-band imaging endocytoscopic classification for predicting colorectal lesions from a retrospective study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-63812-5?utm_source=rct_congratemailt&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=oa_20250924&utm_content=10.1038/s41467-025-63812-5)

- We present a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) model for colorectal lesion classification using narrow-band imaging endocytoscopy (EC-NBI). Inspired by progressive pre-training strategies in large language models, our approach integrates generalized and in-domain pre-training with supervised deep clustering. Evaluated on an independent cohort, the model outperforms state-of-the-art supervised methods at both image and lesion levels, surpassing even experienced endoscopists in human‚Äìmachine competitions. By enhancing diagnostic accuracy and consistency, this CAD system advances the clinical utility of EC-NBI and supports the goal of optical biopsy.
